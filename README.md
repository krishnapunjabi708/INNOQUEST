> **Zone-wise farming recommendations powered by satellite intelligence—no sensors required.**

FarmMatrix is an innovative AI-driven platform that leverages satellite imagery to generate comprehensive soil health reports and deliver actionable, zone-level farming insights without the need for physical sensors or costly laboratory testing.

## 🌾 Problem Statement

Small farmers worldwide, especially in rural India, face critical challenges:

- **No accessible soil testing**: Labs are far away, tests cost ₹300-₹500, and results take weeks
- **Resource waste**: Uniform treatment across fields leads to 40% of farming costs in wasted water and fertilizer
- **Environmental damage**: Runoff pollutes water bodies and depletes groundwater
- **Hidden field variations**: Soil differences within fields cause 20-30% yield loss
- **Climate unpredictability**: Changing weather patterns require adaptive farming strategies
- **Technology barriers**: Expensive sensors and complex platforms exclude small farmers

## 🚀 Solution Overview

FarmMatrix eliminates these barriers by providing:

### ✨ Key Features
